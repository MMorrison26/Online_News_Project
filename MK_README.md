# Online_News_Project

Questions we can ask:
1) What makes online news popular?
2) Is it when it is published?
3) Is it the title length?
4) Is it the words in the title?

Machine Learning ideas:
Regression Model
Trying to predict which ones will be the most shared and most popular?
Determining if certain words or phrases tend to be shared more often?
