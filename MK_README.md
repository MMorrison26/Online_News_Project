# Online_News_Project

Questions we can ask:
1) What makes online news popular?
2) Is it when it is published?
3) Is it the title length?
4) Is it the words in the title?
5) Is it the positive or negative words in the article?
6) Looking at keywords. Are they tagging it accurately?
7) Do images or videos predict whether it is shared more?
8) Looking at polarity in the text? Are they polarizing articles meant to be provocative?
9) Does article length determine whether it's shared? 

Machine Learning ideas:
Regression Model
Trying to predict which ones will be the most shared and most popular?
Determining if certain words or phrases tend to be shared more often?
Do the more polarizing articles get shared more?
Does positive sentiment or negative sentiment make it more shareable?
