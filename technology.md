# Technologies Used
Please see below for the different tools we deem best fit for this project. 

### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Luckily the dataset we are using has all numeric values in the columns, so it will be an easier clean up process. To do the clean-up we will use pandas in Jupyter lab.   

### Database Storage
We have decided to load the dataset into PGAdmin as the tool. Here we have created a relationship database where we will create multiple tables for the separate information from the original dataset. 

### Machine Learning
This dataset has many columns with different attributes. These could all be looked at as independent variables which is why we want to use a Machine Learning model that is built for that. While a regression model can show us the relationship between the variables, we can also use a clustering model to see which attributes are most together. We have decided the clustering approach may be a good way to help visualize how these attributes group together. 

### Dashboard
To present our findings we will create visualizations on Tableau. With this tool we can create different scatterplots and bar charts to show our findings to questions including (but not limited to):

  * Lengths of articles vs popularity/ shareability
  * Top keywords in the articles shared the most
  * Positive vs negative articleâ€™s popularity/ shareability
